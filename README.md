# prh-scraper
Web Scraper to get company information from the finnish PRH open data.

You have to type in the industry, the city and the maximum amount of results that you want to get.
Scraper will then perform a request to the PRH open data API and return the results in to a table.
It will only display those companies, that have some sort of contact details.

WARNING
The code is rather messy, since I only needed it to work in a specific purpose and tried to get it done quickly.
Feel free to modify it to your needs.
